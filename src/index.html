            <p>As you explored the filters, you probably noticed that <b>cbd/CBD</b> comes up a lot, 150 times to be exact.

            <p>Even argue that <b>grocery</b> refers to weed or drugs considering the frequency of the message (36x) from 23 different people.</p>
            <p>Seems like business is going well. He seems to have a helping hand who made 3 payments to the drug dealer:
                <br>"Joey's sales"
                <br>"3/22-3/23 sales"
                <br>"CBD Joey's plus Ryan's sales"

            <p>His friend [img] actually sent him 19 payments in total throughout the year - with a lot of references to Cannabis.</p>
            <p>The public transactions of the Drug Dealer that I was able to capture were made private since. Good job! üëç But that is exactly the dilemma, once your information is public it's pretty damn difficult to get it back!</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "<b>Elote</b> (Nahuatl: ƒìl≈çtl [ÀàeÀêloÀêtÕ°…¨]),
                    <br>or corn on the cob is a popular street food in Mexico, although it is frequently served at home prepared in the same way (boiled or grilled in husk).[1] It is customarily consumed on a stick, or by grasping the husk of the cob that has been pulled down to form a handle". Condiments such as salt, chili powder, butter, cheese, lemon juice or lime juice, mayonnaise, and sour cream (or crema) are usually added to the elote.
                    <br>
                    <br>Another way of presenting elotes is by serving the cut kernels in a bowl. In the southern and central areas of Mexico, people call this esquites instead of elote. Any of the toppings above are added to the corn and it is then eaten with a spoon.
                    <br>
                    <br>In the southern and central urban zones of Mexico, ready-to-eat boiled elotes are usually sold by street vendors or in stands, but in the rest of Mexico elotes are more frequently sold in stores or restaurants. The elotes are boiled in water or grilled over coals and condiments of the customer's choosing are added when sold."

            <p>The food cart's most frequent customer, came here 34 times in 2017, almost every week except in the summer (July - September) and always around the same time. How convenient is it that you can pay for your delicious snacks via Venmo, especialy when it gets crowded. In this case everybody can learn when you're craving what food and where to find you.</p>

            <h1>Two Love Stories</h1>
            <p>Life writes the best stories, and there are sad and there are happy ones. I discovered these two pairs while looking for the transactions with the most comments. One can find whole conversations in the comments, almost like a chat!</p>
            <p>Interestingly, all four of them and in fact most people who comment a lot have very few transactions in the whole year of 2017 which makes me wonder if they are familiar with the platform enough to know that everything is public by default.</p>
            <h2>A sad story</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 2em">üíî</p>
            <p>To protect their privacy I am going to call the protaginists of the first story Susana and Gonzalo. They decided to discuss their relationship matters in public. Or was that really a conscious choice?</p>
            <p>The two of them are also quite new to the at the time this happened, they registered on Venmo on January 14 and January 20.</p>

            <p>In this story you can witness how Breezy and Pedro ‚Äì two placeholder names ‚Äì start to get to know each other in public. They discuss specific transaction amounts and their living situation in Clute, TX and Houston, TX. After exchanging messages every day, sometimes in real time, for about a week (October 20-28), they decided to move on from Venmo. I hope it had a happy ending!</p>
            <p>Pedro and Breezy are also fairly fresh users, having registered on September 6 and October 8 respectively.</p>

            <h1>All American</h1>
            <p>This married couple ‚Äì they share the last name ‚Äì had <b>503</b> transactions between each other.</p>
            <p>They own a <b>dog</b> and a <b>car</b> which they prefer to fuel at Chevron almost every two weeks. They really like <b>pizza</b>, their favorite is at Shakey's, occasionally they also eat Asian and German food.</p>
            <p>And they are paying a <b>loan</b> - 20 transactions last year to be exact, usually paid Thursday, Friday or Saturday. It's always the same person making <span class="cat1">payments</span> to the other, not always in full and also <b>not constistently</b> at the beginning or the end of the month. 3 transactions are <span class="cat2">charges</span>, meaning the person who pays the loan requests money - loan refund.</p>
            <div id="loan" class="timeline"></div>
            <div class="clear"></div>
            <p>Our married couple is a great example to show how your transactions can reveal a lot of things about you, including some life patterns. By far the most transactions are for grocery stores ‚Äì 25 x <span class="walmart">Walmart</span>, 19 x <span class="albertsons">Albertsons</span> and 15 x <span class="costco">CostCo</span>. They went to <span>Aldi</span> and <span>Walgreens</span> a few times. They go shopping more than once a week, almost never on Wednesday or Sunday.</p>

            <p>Looking at all transactions, I believe that the both of them live in <b>Orange County</b>.</p>
            <p>There are 8 transactions including the term <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sdg%26e&oq=SDG%26E" target="_blank">SDG&E</a>. San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) "provides natural gas and electricity to San Diego County and southern Orange County in southwestern California". They visited a theater in the region (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=regal+eastvale" target="_blank">Regal Eastvale</a>), "Chicago Ribs" appears 5 times (could be a reference to "Chicago for Ribs" restaurant that has <a href="http://www.chicagoforribs.com/locations.html" target="_blank">3 locations</a> (Los Angeles, San Pedro and Redondo Beach), <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/?q=lax" target="_blank">LAX</a>, the airport in Los Angeles, is mentioned twice about one month apart. Other transactions that support this assumption include the <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/docs/default-source/downloads/Locations_Printable.pdf">In n out</a>, <a href="https://aldi.us/stores/" target="_blank">Aldi</a> (within California only in the south), and "Banfield Pet Hospital".</p>
